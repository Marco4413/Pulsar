# Pulsar Examples

Welcome to the examples folder of Pulsar.

Here you'll find examples separated into 4 categories:
1. [Basic](basic)
2. [Intermediate](intermediate)
3. [Advanced](advanced)
4. [Neutron](neutron)

As you can see, the first 3 are based on "complexity". Each folder
has examples ordered based on knowledge required to read them
(i.e. example 00 must be understood before 01) or complexity
within their category.

I'd strongly recommend to read the [docs/LANGUAGE](docs/LANGUAGE.md)
first, as some examples take things for granted (like instructions).

Moreover, the last folder will contain Pulsar source files with their
respective Neutron file representation (the Pulsar bytecode representation).

Have fun digging through Pulsar!
