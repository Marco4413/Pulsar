# Pulsar

*A small stack-based dynamically-typed interpreted scripting language.*

> The main purpose of this language is to be an alternative to CSS
in an highly anticipated upcoming JavaScript Framework,
which will revolutionize the Web as we know it
by exposing the, still untouched, performance of modern web browsers.

Not really. It's just another side-project of mine.
I wanted to have a second attempt at creating a programming language.
